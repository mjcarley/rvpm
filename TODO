# sorting on Morton index and identification of nearest neighbours

# implement time-stepping with solver struct containing main options

# separate velocity evaluation into suitable sized array (velocity and,
#  optionally, velocity gradient) from time stepping proper, to allow
#  addition of externally imposed velocities, e.g. from lifting line

# handling of near-field interactions with regularised kernels (subtract
# singular kernel term and add regularised)
